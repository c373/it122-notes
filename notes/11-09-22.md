### Database

- physical container for collections

  **Types**
  - Relational
  - In memory
  - Document
  - Graph
  - Time Series

### Database Type - Relational

Relational databases store data with predefined 
schemas and relationships between them. 
These databases are designed to support ACID 
transactions, and maintain referential integrity 
and strong data consistency.

**Use Cases**

- Traditional applications
- enterprise resource planning (ERP)
- customer relationship management (CRM)
- Ecommerce

**Example**

- PostgreSQL
- MySQL
- Oracle 
- Microsoft SQL Server

### Database Type - In-memory

In-memory databases are used for applications 
that require real-time access to data. By storing 
data directly in memory, these databases deliver 
microsecond latency to applications for whom 
millisecond latency is not enough.

**Use Cases**

- Caching
- session management
- gaming leaderboards
- geospatial applications

**Example**

- Redis
- MemCached

### Database Type - document

A document database is designed to store 
semistructured data as JSON-like documents. 
These databases help developers build and 
update applications quickly.

**Use Cases**

- Content management
- Catalogs
- user profiles

### Database Type - Graph

Graph databases are for applications that need 
to navigate and query millions of relationships 
between highly connected graph datasets with 
millisecond latency at large scale

**Use Case**

- Fraud detection
- social networking
- recommendation engines

### Database Type - Time Series

Time-series databases efficiently collect, 
synthesize, and derive insights from data that 
changes over time and with queries spanning 
time intervals.

**Use Case**

- Internet of Things (IoT) applications
- industrial telemetry
- DevOps
